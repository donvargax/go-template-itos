# Architecture

The private counting domain owns line/word semantics and its result. It reads through a Files
port whose outcomes describe the required file input without exposing OS-specific models. A
disk adapter implements real read-only access; an in-memory fake holds domain test inputs and
failures. Unit tests assert outcomes, and the rapid property checks addition for
newline-terminated pieces.

The domain does not know command-line flags, JSON or exit codes. Those belong to the `count`
handler, which carries the command's domain data into the domain through the port and holds no
counting of its own, and to the kong UI in front of it, which maps each typed failure to its
exit code and prints the JSON or the text answer. `cmd/go-template-itos` is that UI's entry
point; `features/` holds the public behaviour as scenarios, which godog runs against the binary
the harness builds for the platform it is on.

Line separators are LF, with CRLF counted once; a nonempty final unterminated line counts.
Words follow the standard-library Unicode-whitespace rule. No encoding detection or linguistic
word segmentation is performed. File data is not executed or changed.

Root policy and documentation are inherited from `main`. Language-specific gates travel with
their code; stack and feature branches remain buildable projects. Rendering and updating belong
to itos-template, not to this example's domain.
