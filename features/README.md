# Feature files

Every `feat:` and `fix:` commit of a project made from this template is driven by scenarios in
this folder. Nothing else belongs here. The harness is harvested from itos's
(github.com/donvargax/itos, `features/`) and itos-template's, without either one's own
generator behaviour.

## What goes in a feature file

Only behaviour a user of the made project can observe: what a command does to a folder, its exit
code, and what it prints.

Never here:

- code structure, dead code, dependencies, formatting (`gofmt`, `go vet`, golangci-lint,
  govulncheck);
- refactors and performance budgets (tasks in `tasks/`);
- internal logic (unit tests, next to the code).

## Black-box boundary

The steps (`*_test.go`, Go, run by [godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog)) treat the binary as
a black box. `TestFeatures` builds it once a run from this tree (`go-template-itos.exe` on
Windows), stamped with a known version and commit, as a release's build is stamped with the
release's. Each scenario gets a scratch folder in a temporary directory, runs the binary in it
and reads its exit code, its output and the files it leaves. A step judges the program by its
command line alone: it never reads its source or calls its code to decide a result.

Commands run in a clean environment: no `GIT_*`, `ITOS_*`, `GO_TEMPLATE_ITOS_*`, `GITHUB_*`,
`GH_*` or `CI` variable of the caller's, no global or system git config, a fixed author, and none
of the caller's claude, itos or its extensions on the PATH. A `GOCOVERDIR` that exists builds the
binary with `-cover` and collects what each run did, for itos-cc to merge with `go test`'s.

## Running them

```sh
go test ./features -count=1                          # every live scenario
go test ./features -count=1 -scenarios='^@ID-CLI-'   # the live scenarios with a matching tag
GOCOVERDIR=$d go test ./features -count=1            # built with -cover, its coverage in $d
itos tests smoke run scenario                        # exactly the smoke set
```

`-scenarios` takes a regular expression over each tag, `@` included. It exists because godog's
own tag filter takes exact tags joined by commas, while itos merges selections into one regular
expression joined by `|`. One that matches no tag fails the run, so a selection never passes by
running nothing. Each scenario is a subtest of `TestFeatures`, named after the scenario.

## Tags

| Tag               | Meaning                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@phase-<n>`      | The phase a scenario belongs to.                                                     |
| `@<item>`         | The work item that turns it green (`@count-cli`).                                     |
| `@ID-<AREA>-<nn>` | Stable scenario ID. Commits reference these. Never reuse or renumber them.           |
| `@bug-<n>`        | Reproduces a fixed bug. Added by `fix:` commits.                                     |
| `@wip`            | Written, not yet implemented. Excluded from every run, and a `feat` may not name it. |

**IDs.** `<AREA>` is one word in capitals for the area of behaviour, and one feature file holds
one area: `COUNT` is `count.feature`, `CLI` is `cli.feature`, `COMPL` is `completion.feature`.
`<nn>` counts up within the area from `01`; a removed scenario's number is not given again. A new
area gets a new word and a new file.

## Commit rules

- `feat:` must add or change scenarios, or reference `@wip` ones it turns green. Footer:
  `Scenarios: ID-COUNT-01` (`itos commit --scenarios`).
- `fix:` must add a `@bug-<n>` scenario that failed before the fix, or reference an existing
  scenario that was failing. Same footer.
- The commit-msg hook checks that the referenced IDs exist and are live at the commit.
- Red first: a slice's steps go alone in a `test` commit, its scenarios still `@wip`
  (`itos commit --item count-cli`).

## The smoke set

The smoke set is the list in `smoke.yaml`: the scenarios every push runs, beside the ones its
commits name. The rule, which `itos tests smoke check scenario` checks:

- **Every feature file with a live scenario has at least one smoke scenario**, listed under the
  file with the reason it was chosen. A file has more only when the list says why (`more`).
- Every ID in the list is a live scenario of the file it is listed under.
- A smoke scenario is fast and central to its file.

So a `feat` that adds a feature file, or makes a `@wip` one live, picks its smoke scenario in the
same commit.

## Writing a scenario

- **Give a check its own wording.** godog matches a step's text whatever its keyword, so a `Then`
  phrased like an existing `Given` runs the setter and cannot fail.
- **A step is one line**, however long.
- **Assert what a user reads**: the exit code, a sentence of the output. Never more of the output
  than the behaviour is about.
- **Never start a description line with `@`.** Gherkin reads it as tags, and godog then refuses
  the file, failing every run of the features.
- **Say why beside the scenario** when a setup would make a reader ask: a comment above the tag
  line.

## The steps this branch's scenarios use

These are the ones the harness must define. Each is a regular expression over the step's text,
with the program named as the built binary is.

| `go-template-itos runs with "…" and the environment "NAME=value"`                     | The same, with that variable added to the clean environment.     |

| `its JSON output gives each problem a rule, a message and a fix`                      | That no problem is missing one of the three.                     |

| `the file "…" holds a line of <n> characters`                                         | A file written for the scenario, long enough to beat a token limit. |
