// Package version is the version go-template-itos says it is, and the commit
// it was built from. Harvested from the owner's itos-template's internal/
// version, which took it from itos's.
//
// The version is the release's tag, written nowhere in the tree: a release's
// build stamps it into the binary with -ldflags
// "-X github.com/itos-corp/go-template-itos/internal/version.stamp=<v>", as
// the scenario harness stamps the binary it builds. A binary built without
// the stamp says the module version Go records: the release's for
// `go install github.com/itos-corp/go-template-itos/cmd/go-template-itos@<x>`,
// a pseudo-version from git (0.0.0-<time>-<commit>, +dirty with changes) for
// a go build in a checkout. One that records none (go run, go test, a build
// with -buildvcs=false) says Dev.
//
// The commit is stamped beside the version: a release's build sets it with
// "-X github.com/itos-corp/go-template-itos/internal/version.commit=<id>",
// GoReleaser's full commit, and the scenario harness sets a known one. A
// binary built without the stamp says the vcs.revision Go records for a build
// in a checkout; one that records none (go install of a module, go run, go
// test, a build with -buildvcs=false) knows no commit, and says none.
